  <!-- Navigation bar -->
  <!-- A "div" creates a division or a container. In this case the class attribute set to "topnav". The class attribute allows you 
    to apply styles or target this specific division within our CSS or JavaScript file. In this case, "topnav" is used to style
    or position this container at the top of the webpage as a navigation bar. The div begins with <div and is closed with </div>, with
    all the elements in between being contained within that div. -->
  <div class="topnav">
    <!-- Button which takes you to C2Smarter Home Page -->
    <!-- Within the <div>, there's a <button> element. The class="topbuttonsleft" assigns the class "topbuttonsleft" to the button element. 
      Similar to the div, this allows for styling or targeting this button within our CSS or JS file. onclick="showHome()" is an event handler attribute. 
      It specifies a JavaScript function (showHome()) to be executed when the button is clicked. We define the function within our JS file.
      The text "NYC Fire Stations" is the visible content of the button. This is what the user sees and interacts with on the webpage. -->
